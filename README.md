  -yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
 
  -the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
 
  -the total stock volume of the stock

*conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red

*able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"
